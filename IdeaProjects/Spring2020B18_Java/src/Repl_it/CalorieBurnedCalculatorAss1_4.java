One way to measure the amount of energy that is expended during exercise
is to use metabolic equivalents (MET).
Here are some METS for various activities:
- Running 6 MPH: 10 METS
- Basketball: 8 METS
- Sleeping: 1 MET
METS are given per minute.

The number of calories burned per minute may be estimated using the
following formula:
cal = 0.0175 * MET * Weight in kilograms

Write a program that asks user to enter his weight in pounds, and then
calculates and outputs the total number of calories burned for a  person
who runs 6 MPH for 30 minutes, plays basketball for 30 minutes, and then
sleeps for 6 hours. One kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds. use (int)cal to
 round a double value.
Example:

output: Enter weight in pounds:
input: 150
output: Calories Burned: 1073
