write a program that can return the duplicated values from an ArrayList of String
		Ex:
			list: {"A", "B", "A", "C", "D"};
			output: ["A"]
			list: {"A", "B", "B", "C", "D", "D"};
			output: ["A", "C"]
			1. Find the frequency of each element from index 0
			2. create a variable count
			3. need a loop for, for each
