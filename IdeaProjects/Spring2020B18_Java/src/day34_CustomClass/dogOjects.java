                        dog1.breed = "Husky";
                        System.out.println(dog1.breed); // Husky

                        dog1.size = "Small";
                        dog1.color = "White";

                        dog1.age = 4;
                        // after initializing them ==> I can print them out. Before initializing ==> default values like null or 0
                        System.out.println(dog1.size);
                        System.out.println(dog1.color);
