Task01:
        create a class called KgTopounds, and write a program that can convert Kg to pound and print the result
            Ex:
                kg = 10;
                output:
                    10 kg is equal to 22.0462 pounds
                kg = 20
                output:
                    20 kg is equal to 44.0925 pound
